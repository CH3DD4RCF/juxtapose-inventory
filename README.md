# juxtapose-inventory
inventory manager for my mom's poshmark reselling business.

My first C++ project, written in Qt. It's nothing real fancy, just an interface for managing an inventory of items, keeping track of their cost, whether they've sold, and some details about the item. Items are stored in .xml files.
